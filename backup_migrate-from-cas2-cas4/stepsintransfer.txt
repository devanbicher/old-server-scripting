first an outline for doing a backup.

it should just be assumed that the backing up is done in the folder you are trying to backup in. 
but you will need to supply the name of the folder to do the backing up.

1. check if the private folder exists, make it if not
2. check for a file_private_path variable
3. set the variable if it is not set.
4. make the folders <site>/files/private/backup_migrate/manual
5. set permissions to .../manual to allow the server to write to it
       a. chgrp -R casadmin private
       b. chmod g+w private/backup_migrate/manual
6. copy the backupfile, if successful, to cas4: cas2backup_migrate-bus
